## Team Description 
This project has been created by Aegis team 10 in a codeathon event conducted on 18-09-2025. The team members of the group project are : Vyom, Zain, Rajshekar and Himanshu 
from CsIT (AIML). 

## Project Overview
It is a multilingual, minimalist mobile application designed for one-touch emergency reporting and evidence gathering, specifically for our REVA University community.

Our philosophy is simple: absolute simplicity in the face of absolute stress.

There is no login, no sign-up, no complicated menus for a victim to navigate. You open the app, and you are met with a single, large, interactive button: 'REPORT INCIDENT'. That's it. One press is all it takes to set in motion a powerful, automated safety net.
